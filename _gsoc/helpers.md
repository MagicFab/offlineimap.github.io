We understand some information are private data, so **consider sending a private mail** to **both** mentors.

* Name
* Country and timezone
* Short bioagraphical information
  - skills (check the required skills, perfect matching may not be mandatory)
  - education
  - open source experience
* What tools do you know/use? *(text editor, source code management system, daily OS, etc)*
* Github pseudo *(if any)*

* Your ideas, questions, etc

{:.note}
{{ icons.note }} Tip: {{ icons.end }}
Avoid asking for the obvious, that's annoying. Check out the project and the online documentation first.


## Decided to apply?

{:.warning}
{{ icons.note }} Important: {{ icons.end }}
At this point, it's best starting a **public thread** in our [mailing list]({{ links.mailing_list.subscribe }})!

The next step:

* Brief introduction about you for the community.
* Why you? *(optional)*
* Send your proposal(s) or expose your ideas if you don't have a draft yet.

{:.note}
{{ icons.note }} Tip: {{ icons.end }}
Don't bother too much about making the kick-ass impression at this stage. **This should not take your day!**


## What next?

Once your porposal(s) submitted, there are lot of things you can do instead of waiting for the next step.

###### Become a real member

Subscribe the mailing list and create a github account.

###### Try OfflineIMAP

imapfw intend to replace OfflineIMAP. Give it a try, see what it does. *(Deep knowledge of OfflineIMAP is not required required, though.)*

###### Read about imapfw

There is already released ressources about it. Help yourself. If it's not already done, read them. Ask if you're not missing something important unless you're sure of you.

###### Try imapfw

While still at early development stage, imapfw can already run commands. Get the source and try them.

###### Read the source code

Understanding the full codebase at the first shot is not human. Try to correctly identify the key parts, first. Then, try to understand hunks you feel critical.

There are mainly two ways:
* bottom-up: from low-level to high-level
* top-down: from high-level to low-level

In practice you might mix both. Trying to understand if it's low-level or high-level code will greatly help you.

###### Identify the libraries

We use third-party libraries. One is embedded with the codebase.

###### Ensure you have a proper environment

Are you missing a tool? Do they work?

###### Play with imapfw

Again, imapfw can already run commands. Try to make use of the rascal by yourself. Play with it. Break things and read the errors to fix your configuration.

###### Report broken expectations

Code is moving, documentation might be missing or hard to understand. Report us what you think need improvements (and why if applicable).

###### Try to provide some patches

Don't wait for the GSoC to send some changes. Start little but don't wait! It can be about anything (code, documentation, README, etc). Even typos need to be fixes. If you still didn't send your first patch, you're not ready yet. ,-)

{:.note}
{{ icons.note }} Tip: {{ icons.end }}
At any stage, ask us if you're stuck. While we do expect you to fix your own issues as much as possible, it's stupid to spend hours in researches when someone can help.
