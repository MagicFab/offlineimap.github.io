This is the *OfflineIMAP community's website*. It is made **open**, **static** and **easy**.

You can expect maintainers and users to blog here about **OfflineIMAP**.

The website engine is [Jekyll][jekyll] which uses the *[kramdown syntax][kramdown]*, derivated from the well-known *markdown*.  The source of this page (`about.md`) is a good sample of the basics of the syntax. See how it's made easy to contribute to the site by yourself.

You are welcome to propose updates or write your own blog post. ,-)
