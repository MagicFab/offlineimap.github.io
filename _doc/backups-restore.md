It's good practice to start by making **yet another backup of both the Maildir and the cache**, before anything else.

The best way to restore a backup is to start from a clean *"empty"* state.


## Clean the cache

The cache stands in the path defined by the `metadata` configuration option. By default it's `~/.offlineimap`.

The cache files depends on you cache settings:
- `plain`, for plain text
- `sqlite`

All have a name in the from `Account-<account_name>`. Delete them all for the `<account_name>` you want to restore.


## Clean the Maildir

Move the maildir directory to `<maildir>.old` and create a fresh new empty maildir directory.

{% highlight bash %}
$ mv <maildir> <maildir>.old
$ mkdir <maildir>
{% endhighlight %}


## Make a new fresh sync

It's now time to perform a first sync. This will download all the mails of the remote server and write a fresh cache.


## Restore the backup

### Locally, first

Then, copy the content (your raw mails) from the backup to the fresh Maildir.

{: .note}
{{ icons.note }} Note: {{ icons.end }}
Compare the trees between the backup and the fresh Maildir before restoring the mails. Especially if you are restoring onto another IMAP server.
Â 
The trees must match or you'll have to manually restore the content in a per-folder basis.


### On the remote

Finally, sync again. The local mails are synced back to the server.

{: .note}
{{ icons.note }} Note: {{ icons.end }}
Don't forget to set `readonly = False` on the remote side.
