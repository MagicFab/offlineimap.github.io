This document contains assorted guidelines for programmers that want
to hack OfflineIMAP.


------------------
Exception handling
------------------

OfflineIMAP on many occasions re-raises various exceptions and often
changes exception type to `OfflineImapError`.  This is not a problem
per se, but you must always remember that we need to preserve original
tracebacks.  This is not hard if you follow these simple rules.

For re-raising original exceptions, just use::

  raise

from inside your exception handling code.

If you need to change exception type, or its argument, or whatever,
use this three-argument form::

  raise YourExceptionClass(argum, ents), None, sys.exc_info()[2]

In this form, you're creating an instance of new exception, so ``raise``
will deduce its ``type`` and ``value`` parameters from the first argument,
thus the second expression passed to ``raise`` is always ``None``.
And the third one is the traceback object obtained from the thread-safe
``exc_info()`` function.

In fact, if you hadn't already imported the whole ``sys`` module, it will
be better to import just ``exc_info()``::

  from sys import exc_info

and raise like this::

  raise YourExceptionClass(argum, ents), None, exc_info()[2]

since this is the historically-preferred style in the OfflineIMAP code.
