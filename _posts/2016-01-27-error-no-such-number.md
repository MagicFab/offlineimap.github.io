I was using mutt for a long time using the built-in features it has with
connecting to an imap server and to send mail by smtp. With this setup no more
tools besides mutt has been necessary.

But if one want to try some other user agent or start to experiment with mail in
general, soon one discover that a tool for fetching mail and using a maildir is
a popular choice.

Mutt is great and will remain there for me in the terminal, but it is now
spawning my maildir which is populated and synchronized by offlineimap.

At the first try with offlineimap I got a bit of trouble that remained for some
time, and I want to share that trouble with you and how I solved it.

## The fix

Fix me.

*Is this a red style kind of notice?*

## Conclusion

Do we have a nice and clever conclusion here?

Make a change.
