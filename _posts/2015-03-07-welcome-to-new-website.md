I've started a new website. Let us know your feedbacks!

<!--more-->

It's is done with the [Github pages](https://github.com/OfflineIMAP/offlineimap.github.io) and is powered by Jeykyll behind the hood.

### Why a new website? ###

Well, mostly because I aim to make it be more accessible.
I hope this will allow more contributions from our community.

Also, I think this is a good opportunity to rewrite parts of the documentation
which tend to be fragmented and badly structured.

So, the big change is that it's made **open**, **static** and **easy**. Refer to the
[About]({{ site.baseurl }}/about) page for more detailed information.
